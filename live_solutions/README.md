# Live solutions to be synced to participants

This directory contains live solutions that can be synced to the participants' machines via git. Initially this directory will contain the skeleton files from the `code` directory. As we work our way through the turorial, we will add solutions to these skeleton files and we will sync these solutions to the repository. By means of syncing with the repository, participants' will thus obtain sample solutions that grow as the tutorial progresses.

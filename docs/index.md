# Tutorial Outline

On this companion page you can find accompanying software, data, and `jupyter` notebooks for the KDD2018 Hands-on Tutorial [](Beyond Graph Mining: Higher-Order Data Analytics for Temporal Network Data). the tutorial will follow the following outline: 

**Session 1: Introduction to Higher-Order Network Models**
- *Lecture:* Higher-order Models of Temporal Network Data (45 minutes)
- *Tutorial:* Learning Optimal Network Models in Time Series Data (45 minutes)

**Session 2: Higher-Order Graph Clustering**
- *Lecture:* Higher-order Graph Clustering with the MapEquation (45 minutes)
- *Tutorial:* Clustering Citation Flows using InfoMap (45 minutes)

**Session 3: Higher-Order Node Ranking**
- *Lecture:* Higher-order Centrality Measures (45 minutes)
- *Tutorial:* Predicting click rates with Higher-order PageRank (45 minutes)

**Session 4: Higher-order Network Visualisation**
- *Tutorial:* Higher-order network visualisation in d3js (45 minutes)
- *Tutorial:* Alluvial diagrams with d3js (45 minutes)

# Setting up the environment

To complete the hands-on exercises, you will need a working `python 3.x` environment, installed under the operating system of your choice. For Windows, macOS, and Linux users we recommend using the latest [https://www.anaconda.com/download/](Anaconda 5.2) installation. To complete the exercises, we further highly recommend using the development environment [https://code.visualstudio.com/Download](Visual Studio Code), an OpenSource code editor available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Once installed, please additionally install the [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python](Python) and [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=donjayamanne.jupyter](Jupyter) extensions, which are available free of charge via Visual Studio Code's integrated extension marketplace.

To apply higher-order data analytics to real data, we finally need two additional software packages, which can be installed via gitHub. 

[http://www.pathpy.net](pathpy) is a python package for the analysis of time-stamped and sequential data on complex networks. [http://www.mapequation.org](InfoMap) provides code to reveal overlapping modular patterns in higher-order network flows through complex systems.

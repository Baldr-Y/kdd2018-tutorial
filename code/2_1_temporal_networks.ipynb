But how does this apply to time-stamped network data? \n", "\n", "The key idea is that the specific ordering and timing in which time-stamped edges occur in a `TemporalNetwork` gives rise to so-called **causal or time-respecting paths**. In a nutshell, for two time-stamped edges $(a, b, t)$ and $(b, c, t')$ to contribute to a causal path $a \\rightarrow b \\rightarrow c$ it must hold that $t < t'$. If we reorder the timestamps such that the edge $(b, c)$ occurs **before** (a,b), no causal path $a \\rightarrow b \\rightarrow c$ exists. \n", "\n", "So we see that the chronological order of time-stamped edges crucially influences causal paths, i.e. which nodes can possibly influence each other in a time-stamped edge sequence. Moreover, we often want to limit the maximum time difference between consecutive edges that we consider to contribute to a causal path. For instance, for dynamic social interaction data that spans very long observation sequences of multiple years, it does not make sense to consider all chronologically ordered edges as possible paths for a propagation of information. After all, humans have a limited memory and we should consider interactions occurring far apart in time as independent. \n", "\n", "We can formally add this maximum time difference constraint by setting a parameter $\\delta$, where we consider our two edges  $(a, b, t)$ and $(b, c, t')$ to only contribute to a causal path if $ 0 < t' - t \\leq \\delta$.\n", "\n", "With this definition at hand and by specifying our \"time-scale\" parameter $\\delta$ at which we want to analyse our system, we can now **calculate causal path statistics in time-stamped network data**.

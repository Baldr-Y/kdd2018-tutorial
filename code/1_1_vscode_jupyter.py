"""
In the first two sessions of our hands-on tutorial, 
we use [`jupyter`](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks to 
introduce higher-order network analytics with `pathpy`. 
This file itself is a `jupyter` notebook, that you can 
open, edit, and run using the `jupyter` notebook server. 
If you are not familiar with `jupyter`, please check 
the [jupyter documentation](). 

The easiest way to set up a working `python` 
environment with `jupyter` is to install 
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/), an 
OpenSource `python` distribution pre-configured for 
data science and machine learning tasks.

If you want to learn more about the setup procedure, 
please check the [setup instructions](https://ingoscholtes.github.io/kdd2018-tutorial/setup).

If you want, you can complete the tutorial using the 
browser-based editor that comes with the jupyter notebook 
server. However, to simply the editing of code and the 
visualisation of data, we strongly recommend to use the 
Open Source development environment [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). 
Via the extensions `ms-python.python` and `donjayamanne.jupyter`, 
which you can download and install via the integrated extension system, 
Visual Studio Code provides support both for `python` code editing, debugging, 
and unit testing, as well as for interactive data analytics and visualisation 
with `jupyter`.
